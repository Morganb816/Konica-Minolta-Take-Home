# Konica Minolta Take Home Server

## About
This is Morgan Browns submission for the Konica Minolta Take home test.

## Libraries and sources.
The only outside library used is [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws). WS is used to create our websocket server.

Line segment intersection algorithms were found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-two-given-line-segments-intersect/). I chose to utilize this as to not reinvent the wheel. These are proven and tested algorithms. 

## Setup
1: Clone the repo.

2: `npm i`

## Starting

#### With Client
`npm run start`

#### Server Only
`npm run server`
